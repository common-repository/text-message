Text Message by Biz Text lets your website receive and send text messages. Reply to text messages from a PC or forward messages to your mobile phone.

== Description ==

The Text Message SMS Plugin by [Biz Text](https://biztextsolutions.com?ref=wp%20text%20message%20sms%20plugin) lets your website receive and send text messages (SMS). You can reply and send text messages from your PC through WordPress or from your mobile phone. No Twilio account is needed.

The Text Message SMS Plugin requires an affordable, no-contract, cancel any time Biz Text plan, [see our plan at Biz Text Solutions](https://www.biztextsolutions.com/pricing?ref=wp%20text%20message%20sms%20plugin). A Biz Text plan allows you to choose a ‘Biz Text Number,’ to display on your website, allowing you to receive and send text messages.

When your website visitors send you a text, you can reply to those texts through your WordPress dashboard or forward those text messages to one or more mobile numbers. You can reply to texts from your mobile phone and your website visitors will never see your personal cell phone number.

You can also send texts from WordPress to a mobile number that has not texted you first. Your Biz Text Number can handle voice calls too, so you don’t need a landline number, nor do you need to display your mobile phone number to send and receive text messages.

The Text Message SMS Plugin makes it easy for you to display your Biz Text Number on your website. Choose from link or button styles for your texting options, and only your mobile visitors will see the option to text you, your desktop visitors will see your regular website.

= Key Features = 

* **Receive, Reply, and Send Texts from your WordPress website**
* **Display your Biz Text Number with a Button or Link by shortcode or widget**
* **Fix in position your Button or Biz Text Icon on your website**
* **Assign Biz Text Admin role to user or custom capability to other roles to access plugin settings**
